3) You're given a database (education) with three tables (student, course, institution) as illustrated below:
a) Use the diagram above to create the tables (the database, table and column names should remain
as indicated)


mysql> create database education;
mysql> show databases;
mysql> use education;
mysql> 	create table student (studentid int(11) unsigned not null auto_increment, name varchar(250) not null, course int(11))
	-> create table course (courseid int(11) unsigned not null auto_increment, name varchar(250), institution int(11))
	-> create table institution (institutionid int(11) unsigned not null auto_increment, name varchar(250))

b) Write a MySQL query that will display the number of students per course per institution in the
format below

select INSTITUTION NAME, COURSE NAME, NUMBER OF STUDENTS from student where (INSTITUTION NAME like '%Maximo%', COURSE NAME like '%Maximo%') and NUMBER OF STUDENTS > 1000;
